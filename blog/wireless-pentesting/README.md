# Wireless Pentesting with Kali Linux

Wireless networks are a cornerstone of modern connectivity, but their widespread use makes them a prime target for attackers. As security researchers, we rely on wireless penetration testing tools to identify vulnerabilities in access points (APs), client devices, and network configurations. This guide provides an in-depth look at these tools and a detailed walkthrough for configuring Kali Linux to conduct effective wireless pentests. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced practitioner, this blog will equip you with the knowledge to assess wireless network security systematically.

## Understanding Wireless Penetration Testing

Wireless pentesting involves simulating real-world attacks to evaluate the security posture of wireless networks. The primary goal is to identify vulnerabilities such as weak encryption, misconfigured access points, or unauthorized devices. By using specialized software and hardware tools, we can capture network traffic, detect hidden networks, and test encryption protocols like WEP, WPA, and WPA2. Adopting standardized methodologies, such as the OWASP Wireless Security Testing Guide, ensures thorough and repeatable testing.

The process helps us:

**1. Discover Wi-Fi Networks:** You identify nearby wireless networks, including their names (ESSID) and unique identifiers (BSSID).
**2. Analyze Network Traffic:** You capture data packets transmitted over the Wi-Fi network to understand its behavior and configuration.
**3. Test Encryption Strength:** The ultimate goal in the example is to recover the **Wi-Fi password (passphrase)** for a specific network, typically one using WEP or WPA/WPA2 encryption. This tests whether the network’s password is weak and vulnerable to attacks.
**4. Identify Vulnerabilities:** By attempting to crack the password or exploit weaknesses (like WPS vulnerabilities with Reaver), you’re checking if the network can be compromised by an attacker. This helps determine if the network is secure or needs stronger protections.

In short, we’re trying to **find the Wi-Fi password** of a target network to see if it’s vulnerable to unauthorized access. This is done, with permission, to help secure the network.

The Wi-Fi password is a critical component of network security. If an attacker can crack it, they can:

- Gain unauthorized access to the network.
- Intercept sensitive data (e.g., login credentials or personal information).
- Launch further attacks, like man-in-the-middle attacks or malware distribution.

By attempting to crack the password, we’re simulating what a malicious hacker might do, allowing us to identify and fix weaknesses before they can be exploited.

## Common Wireless Penetration Testing Tools

A variety of tools are available for wireless pentesting, each serving specific purposes in analyzing and exploiting network weaknesses. Below is an overview of the most widely used tools, their capabilities, and their roles in a pentester's toolkit:

**1. Aircrack-ng:** A powerful suite for auditing wireless networks, Aircrack-ng is primarily used to crack WEP and WPA/WPA2-PSK encryption keys. It captures and analyzes network packets to identify vulnerabilities, making it essential for testing encryption strength and recovering passwords.

**2. Wireshark:** A robust network protocol analyzer, Wireshark captures and dissects network traffic to provide detailed insights into transmitted and received packets. It's invaluable for identifying security threats, such as unencrypted data or suspicious traffic patterns.

**3. Kismet**: Kismet is a wireless network detector, sniffer, and intrusion detection system. It excels at discovering hidden networks, detecting rogue access points, and identifying unauthorized devices, offering a comprehensive view of the wireless environment.

**4. NetStumbler:** This tool is designed for Windows environments and is used to detect wireless networks and access points. While less feature-rich than others, it's effective for identifying basic network configurations and potential vulnerabilities.

**5. Reaver:** Reaver targets WPS-enabled wireless networks, exploiting vulnerabilities in the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) protocol to recover WPA/WPA2 passphrases. It's particularly useful for assessing the security of networks using WPS.

**Note:** Always stay updated with the latest tools and techniques. The wireless threat landscape evolves rapidly, and tools like Aircrack-ng and Kismet frequently receive updates to address new vulnerabilities and protocols.

## Configuring Kali Linux for Wireless Penetration Testing

Kali Linux is the go-to operating system for security researchers due to its extensive suite of pre-installed tools and flexibility for wireless pentesting. Properly configuring Kali Linux is critical to conducting effective tests. Below, I provide a step-by-step guide to prepare and configure Kali Linux for wireless attacks, ensuring compatibility with common wireless adapters and tools.

### Preparing Kali Linux

Before conducting wireless pentests, ensure Kali Linux is set up correctly. Follow these steps to prepare the environment:

### 1. Update and Upgrade Kali Linux

Keeping the system up to date ensures compatibility with the latest tools and patches. Open a terminal and run:

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
```

This command updates the package lists and upgrades installed packages.

### 2. Install Wireless Drivers

Many wireless adapters require specific drivers to function correctly in Kali Linux. For Intel-based adapters, install the `firmware-iwlwifi` package:

```
sudo apt-get install firmware-iwlwifi
```

**Note:** The required drivers depend on your wireless adapter. For example, the TP-Link WN722N requires manual driver setup, while ALFA NETWORK cards like the AWUS036NH are highly recommended for their support of 802.11 b/g/n protocols and monitor mode.

### 3. Verify Wireless Interface Availability

Check if the wireless interface is recognized by running:

The output should indicate `Mode:Monitor` for wlan0.

### 6. Scan for Wireless Networks

Use Aircrack-ng's `airodump-ng` to discover available networks:

![](assets/images/8.png)

This displays a list of nearby networks, including their BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier), ESSID (network name), and channel.

### 7. Capture Packets from a Target Network

![](assets/images/9.png)

Select a target network and capture its packets for analysis:

```
sudo airodump-ng --bssid <target_BSSID> -c <channel> -w output_file wlan0
```

Replace `<target_BSSID>` with the target's BSSID, `<channel>` with the network's channel, and `output_file` with your desired output file name. This command captures packets to a `.cap` file.
