# Shodan for Security Researchers

As security researchers, we constantly seek tools that provide deep visibility into the attack surface of networks, devices, and services. Shodan, often dubbed "the search engine for hackers," is a powerful reconnaissance tool that indexes internet-connected devices, offering unparalleled insights into exposed systems. Unlike traditional search engines like Google, which focus on web content, Shodan scans ports and collects service banners to reveal metadata about devices, from webcams to industrial control systems (ICS). This guide provides a detailed, technical introduction to Shodan for beginner to intermediate security researchers, covering its functionality, search syntax, and practical use cases.

## What is Shodan?

![](assets/images/shodan-dashboard.png)

Developed by John Matherly in 2009, Shodan is a search engine that continuously scans the internet, cataloging devices and services by collecting service banners â€” metadata returned by servers and devices when queried. These banners include details like software versions, open ports, and device types. Shodan primarily targets protocols such as HTTP (ports 80, 443), FTP (port 21), SSH (port 22), Telnet (port 23), SNMP (port 161), SIP (port 5060), and RTSP (port 554), among others, covering over 200 services.

By querying Shodan, you can:

- **Discover Uncharted Assets:** Organizations often overlook internet-facing devices like misconfigured servers, IoT devices, or legacy systems. A query like `port:22 product:OpenSSH country:IN` can uncover SSH servers in India that a client didn't know were exposed, expanding your attack surface analysis.
- **Identify Configuration Weaknesses:** Banners often expose software versions or default settings (e.g., `http.title:"Index of /"` for directory listings), highlighting misconfigurations ripe for exploitation.
- **Pinpoint Vulnerabilities:** With filters like `vuln:CVE-2014-0160`, Shodan flags systems potentially affected by known exploits, such as Heartbleed, allowing you to prioritize testing efforts.
- **Monitor Emerging Threats:** Queries like `port:80 country:CA after:2025-04-01` track newly exposed web servers, enabling proactive defense against recent misconfigurations.

This reconnaissance lays the groundwork for a comprehensive penetration testing engagement, providing a starting point to assess a target's security posture before active testing begins.

Note: Unauthorized access to devices found via Shodan is illegal and unethical. This guide focuses on legitimate, ethical use cases for penetration testing, asset management, and threat intelligence.

## Getting Started with Shodan

### 1. Creating an Account

To begin, navigate to shodan.io and create an account. Free accounts are limited to 50 search results and basic functionality, while paid subscriptions unlock advanced filters, API access, and higher result limits. For researchers, a paid account is recommended to leverage Shodan's full potential.

### 2. Understanding the Interface

Shodan's web interface is straightforward:

- **Search Bar:** Enter queries to find devices or services.
- **Filters Sidebar:** Refine results by country, port, organization, etc.
- **Explore:** View popular searches (e.g., webcams, routers) for inspiration.
- **Shodan Monitor:** Set up alerts for new devices matching your criteria.
- **Maps:** Visualize device locations geographically (requires a paid account).

Browser plugins for Chrome and Firefox provide quick insights into a website's exposed services, such as open ports and software versions.

### 3. Shodan CLI

For advanced users, Shodan offers a command-line interface (CLI). Install it using Python:

![](assets/images/1.png)

Initialize the CLI with your API key (found in your Shodan account):

![](assets/images/2.png)

You can now query searches using the Shodan CLI:

![](assets/images/3.png)

For example, the command `shodan search "port:22 country:IN"` should return devices with open SSH ports in India. However, the command failed with a 403 Forbidden error because Shodan's free accounts have extremely limited API access, and my account currently has 0 query credits, as shown by `shodan info`.

The CLI is ideal for scripting and automation but requires familiarity with command-line workflows.

## Shodan Search Syntax and Filters

Shodan's power lies in its query syntax, which allows precise searches using filters. By default, Shodan searches the data property of banners, which contains service-specific metadata (e.g., HTTP headers, FTP welcome messages).

### Basic Search Syntax

- **Simple Queries:** Enter a keyword like `webcam` to find devices with "webcam" in their banners.

![](assets/images/4.png)

This returns IP addresses, ports, and banners for webcams worldwide.

- **Quoted Phrases:** Use quotes for exact matches:

![](assets/images/5.png)

Finds devices running Nginx version 1.14.0.

### Essential Filters

Filters refine searches by specific banner properties. Combine them with keywords for targeted results. Examples:

- **port:** Specify a port number.

```

## Secure Your Own CCTVs Against Shodan Indexing

To prevent your own cameras from appearing in Shodan, apply these best practices:

- **Enable Authentication:** Set strong, unique passwords (not `admin:12345`).
- **Use Firewalls:** Block public access to camera ports (e.g., `554`, `80`) using a firewall.
- **VPN or NAT:** Place cameras behind a VPN or NAT to avoid direct internet exposure.
- **Disable UPnP:** Universal Plug and Play can expose devices unintentionally.
- **Check Exposure:** Search Shodan for your IP or organization (e.g., net:YOUR_IP) to confirm your cameras aren't indexed.

## Use Cases for Security Researchers

## Leveraging Shodan Data

The metadata extracted from Shodan â€” IPs, ports, banners, locations, and screenshots â€” serves as a springboard for actionable steps in a penetration testing workflow. You can integrate and exploit this data ethically and effectively during an authorized engagement:

**1. Initial Reconnaissance and Asset Mapping**

- **Action:** Use a query like `product:Hikvision org:"Client Name"` to identify a client's exposed CCTV systems.
- **Utilization:** Compile a list of IPs and cross-reference with the client's asset inventory. This reveals unauthorized or forgotten devices, such as a Hikvision camera streaming publicly due to a misconfigured firewall.
- **Next Step:** Share this with the client to update their asset management, ensuring all systems are accounted for in the VAPT scope.

**2. Vulnerability Assessment**

- **Action:** Apply `port:27017 product:MongoDB -authentication country:US` to find unauthenticated MongoDB instances.
- **Utilization:** Note the IPs and banners, then validate with a tool like Nmap (`nmap -sV -p 27017 <IP>`) to confirm the lack of authentication. Check banner versions against vulnerability databases (e.g., NIST NVD) for CVEs like CVE-2015-7882 (MongoDB remote code execution).
- **Next Step:** Document potential vulnerabilities in a report, recommending patches or access controls, and test exploitation (if authorized) to assess impact.

**3. Penetration Testing**

- **Action:** Target `port:8291 product:RouterOS version:"6.29" country:BR` to locate vulnerable MikroTik routers.
- **Utilization:** Extract IP addresses and use Metasploit (use `exploit/windows/http/mikrotik_routeros_cmd`) to simulate CVE-2018-14847 exploitation, confirming remote code execution potential. Cross-check with banner data to ensure version accuracy.
- **Next Step:** If successful, document the exploit path and suggest firmware updates or network segmentation to mitigate risks.

**4. Threat Intelligence and Reporting**

- **Action:** Run `port:23 "Login incorrect" country:CN` to detect Telnet devices with default credentials.
- **Utilization:** Analyze the prevalence of such devices to build a threat profile for a client's region. Manually copy IPs and banners (due to the free account's export limitation) into a spreadsheet for tracking.
- **Next Step:** Include this in a penetration testing report, highlighting IoT exposure risks and recommending credential changes or Telnet disabling, supported by real-world attack examples (e.g., Mirai botnet).

**5. Continuous Monitoring**

- **Action:** Set up a saved search for `port:80 country:CA after:2025-04-01` to monitor new web servers.
- **Utilization:** Periodically revisit the query to detect newly exposed systems, using location and organization data to correlate with client networks.

- **Validate Findings:** Shodan data may be outdated; use Nmap or manual testing to confirm vulnerabilities.
- **Document Results:** Manually copy IPs and banners into a text file (free account limitation) for reporting.
- **Stay Within Limits:** The 50-result cap requires prioritizing high-risk systems; rerun queries as needed.
- **Ethical Scope:** Limit queries to authorized targets to avoid legal issues.

## Practical Workflow with Shodan

- **Recon Phase:** Start with broad queries (e.g., `webcam` or `port:22`) to map the landscape, then refine with filters to focus on client-specific assets.
- **Assessment Phase:** Use vulnerability-targeted queries (e.g., `vuln:CVE-2014-0160`) to prioritize high-risk systems, validating with active scans if authorized.
- **Exploitation Phase:** Leverage Shodan IPs for controlled penetration testing (e.g., Metasploit, Nmap) to simulate attacks, ensuring all actions are within scope.
- **Reporting Phase:** Document Shodan findingsâ€”IPs, banners, potential CVEsâ€”in a detailed report, offering remediation strategies like patching or reconfiguration.

## Tools to Complement Shodan Findings

- **Nmap:** Validate ports and versions (e.g., `nmap -sV -p 22 <IP>`).
- **Metasploit:** Test exploits on identified vulnerabilities (e.g., SSH or RouterOS modules).
- **Wireshark:** Analyze traffic from authorized CCTV or server tests.
- **Censys:** Cross-check findings for broader coverage (e.g., `services.port:22 location.country_code:IN`).

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Misinterpreting Banners:** Banners can be spoofed or outdated. Verify findings with active scanning (if authorized).
- **Overloading Queries:** Complex queries may exceed free account limits. Upgrade or simplify searches.
- **Ignoring Context:** A device listed on Shodan isn't necessarily vulnerable. Check for authentication or firewalls.

## Ethical and Legal Considerations

- **Do Not Access Unauthorized Systems:** Querying Shodan is legal, but attempting to log in to devices (even with default credentials) without permission is illegal.
- **Obtain Authorization:** For pentesting, ensure you have explicit client consent.
- **Secure Your Own Assets:** Use Shodan to audit your organization's exposure (e.g., search for org:"Your Company" "default password").
- **Report Vulnerabilities Responsibly:** If you discover exposed systems, notify the owner or follow responsible disclosure protocols.
